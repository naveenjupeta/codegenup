 2. The Python function is defined as `def sum_list(nums):`, so the Java method should be defined as `public int sumList(int[] nums)`.
 3. The Python function has a docstring that describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return value. The Java method should have a similar documentation comment.
 4. The Python function uses recursion to sum the numbers in the list. The Java method should also use recursion.
 5. The Python function has a runtime complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). The Java method should have similar complexities.
 6. The Python function has doctests to verify its correctness. The Java method should also have tests to verify its correctness.

Here is the Java method that implements the sum_list function:

```java
/**
 * Using recursion, return the sum of numbers in a list.
 *
 * @param nums An array of integers
 * @return The sum of the integers in the array
 */
public int sumList(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) {
