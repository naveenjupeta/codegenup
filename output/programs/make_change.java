 2. The function returns the number of ways to make the amount of money with coins of the available denominations.
 3. The function uses recursion to solve the problem.
 4. The function has a base case that checks if the amount is 0, in which case it returns 1.
 5. The function also has a base case that checks if the amount is less than 0, in which case it returns 0.
 6. The function has another base case that checks if the index is equal to the length of the denominations list, in which case it returns 0.
 7. The function then defines a variable `current_coin` that stores the current coin denomination from the `denominations` list using the `index` argument.
 8. The function then defines a variable `combos` that stores the number of combinations of coins that add up to the `amount`.
 9. The function then enters a `while` loop that iterates while the `amount` is greater than or equal to 0.
