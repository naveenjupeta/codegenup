 2. To accomplish this, I will need to understand the structure of the Python file and how it is organized. I will also need to understand the Java syntax and best practices for writing code.
 3. Once I have a good understanding of the Python file, I will be able to translate the code into Java. I will need to make sure that the translated code is syntactically correct and follows the Java best practices.
 4. To ensure the translated code is correct, I will run the translated code and compare its output with the original Python code. I will also run tests to verify that the translated code behaves as expected.
 5. Finally, I will document the translated code and provide comments explaining the translation process and any changes I made. This will help others understand and use the translated code.

```python

    return eval(expression)
