 2. To convert the Python code to Java code, we need to understand the Python code and translate it into Java code.
 3. The code imports the `uniform` function from the `random` module and uses it to generate a list of 100 random numbers between 0 and 1000, rounded to three decimal places.
 4. The code defines a function `sort_fractional` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers sorted based on the fractional portion of each number.
 5. The code uses the `map` function to convert the list of numbers to a list of strings, and then iterates over the list of strings to extract the fractional portion by finding the location of the decimal point ('.') and slicing the string accordingly.
 6. The code uses the `sorted` function to sort the list of strings based on the extracted fractional portions.
 7. The code prints the sorted list of strings using the `print` function.

Here is the Java code that implements the above steps:
