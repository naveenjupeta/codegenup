 2. recursive_index_2: This function uses recursion to search for the needle in the haystack list. It returns the index of the needle if found, or None if the needle is not in the haystack. The function uses the `recursive_index_2` function to search for the needle in the remaining sublist of haystack. The base case is when the haystack list is empty or the needle is not in the haystack, in which case the function returns None.
