  1. Create a new Java class named `RateChecker` with two instance variables: `actions` and `seconds`.
  2. Create a constructor method that takes the same parameters as the Python `__init__` method and assigns them to the instance variables.
  3. Create a `check` method that returns a boolean value based on the number of actions and the time elapsed since the last check.
  4. Use the `DateTime` class to handle time-related operations in Java.
  5. Use the `sleep` method to simulate the `time.sleep` function in Python.

  Here's how you can implement this in Java:

  ```java
  import java.time.Duration;
  import java.time.Instant;
  import java.util.ArrayDeque;
  import java.util.Deque;

  public class RateChecker {
      private final int actions;
      private final int seconds;
      private final Deque<Instant> times;  // Use a queue to keep track of check times

      public RateChecker(int actions, int seconds) {
          this.actions = actions;
          this.seconds = seconds;
